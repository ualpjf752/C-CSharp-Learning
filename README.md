# C & C# Learning Path 🚀

This repository is dedicated to mastering low-level programming with **C** and modern application development with **C# (.NET)**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Languages:** C (GCC) and C# (.NET 8.0)
- **IDE/Editor:** Visual Studio Code
- **Compilers:** w64devkit (GCC) & .NET SDK
- **Focus:** Memory management, Pointers (C) and Object-Oriented Logic (C#).

## 📁 Repository Structure

To maintain a clean environment, the projects are organized into dedicated directories:

* **`C_Basics/`**: Pure C source files (`.c`). Focus on fundamental syntax and manual memory handling.
* **`CSharp_Projects/`**: .NET Console Applications. Focus on the C# ecosystem and OOP patterns.

## 🚀 How to Run

### For C Programs:
1.  Navigate to the directory: `cd C_Basics`
2.  Compile the source: `gcc hello_world.c -o hello.exe`
3.  Execute the binary: `./hello.exe`

### For C# Projects:
1.  Navigate to the project folder: `cd CSharp_Projects/[ProjectName]`
2.  Run the application: `dotnet run`
